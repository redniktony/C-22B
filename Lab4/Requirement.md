Lab requirements
=================
You will write a program to read a file containing movie data (Tile, Director, Year Released, Running Time) into a vector of structures.

The user of your program may ask to see the data on the screen sorted by title, director, year released or running time.

Use the sort function (#include <algorithm>) to sort the requested data. You will need different comparison functions to pass to sort() depending on what field the data will be sorted.
